      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>My name is Mohammed, also known by Mickey. I am an undergraduate computer engineering student who is passionate about game and game development.</h4>
      <p>
	  I create games for PC and smartphones. I prefer 3D to 2D and always prefer creating my own assets rather using others’ even if they’re free. <br><br>
I started my journey in early 2014 when I came across a game called “Attack on titans tribute game” by Feng Lee which he made it mostly by himself on the Unity Game Engine. Before that, I wanted to create games on my own games but thought it was something impossible for a person to achieve and that it’s only meant for huge companies like “Rock Star Games”. <br><br>
During the journey, I started acquiring different skills and leveling up. I learned more about game programming and creating my own assets. I started learning about 3D modelling too including the workflow to produce a ready game asset. I also textured, rigged, and animated the 3D models I created. I did not stop here. However, I kept pushing my limits and decided to create VR applications that are optimized for mobile. <br><br>
For creating games, my weapons are a piece of paper to write down and sketch a rough concept, then I jump to 3ds max to create the 3D models and animate them if needed. I later texture them using photoshop combined with substance designer but most of the time I only need photoshop. After that the main show starts in Unity engine. <br><br>
I did not only use Unity on my journey, I tried another engine which is Unreal Engine 4, but found that Unity’s interface is a lot easier. I am willing to learn different engines if needed.
